Retrospective of third week:
* [ALL] Regarding the SD part of the project. Both groups had problems implementing
their respective parts, hence the reason why there are such discrepancies 
between the estimated time and real time, and some tasks werenÂ´t fully developed,
or even developed.
Because of this, we all developed the SD part as a group, as opposed to
having tasks partitioned by each member.

* [marcoist]  The last task relative to ES was done without major issues.

* [PJBNascimento] The last task relative to ES was done without major issues.
