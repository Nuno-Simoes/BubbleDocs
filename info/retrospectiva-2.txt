Retrospective of second week:
* [ALL] As a group we decided to implement all the tasks relative to the 
ES part of the project, even implementing some tasks that weren't initially 
planned for the last week (#51, #55, #71, #77, #79, #93, #94). Leaving the 
planned tasks relative to SD to be implemented in the third week.

* [AfrAndrade] Some tasks were implemented by others because they were needed for their implementation/verification. 
The rest were implemented without trouble.

* [BrunoS92] All tasks were implemented without any major problems or
set backs.

* [marcoist] All tasks were implemented without any major problems or
set backs, except the task #82 because I have some doubts about its
implementation.

* [Nuno-Simoes] All tasks were implemented without any major problems or
set backs. Implemented a task belonging to AfrAndrade, #39.

* [PJBNascimento] All tasks were implemented without any major problems or
set backs.

* [ritap420] I implemented two tasks #58, #68, that were initially assigned
to AfrAndrade, seeing as all his assigned tasks weren't implemented, and
they were needed in various tasks relative to mine and the rest of the
members.
